## What is Regression?

- A way of predicting the value of one variable from other variables.

    - It is a hypothetical model of the relationship between two or more variables.
    - The model used is a linear one in these notes, doesn't always have to be! 
    - Therefore, we describe the relationship using the equation of a straight line.

## Describing a Straight Line

$$Y_i = b_0 + b_1X_i + \varepsilon_i$$

- What is $b_i$?

    - Regression coefficient for the predictor
    - Gradient (slope) of the regression line
    - Direction/Strength of Relationship.
    
- What is $b_0$?

    - Intercept (value of Y when X(s) = 0)
    - Point at which the regression line crosses the Y-axis

## Intercepts and Gradients

```

## Types of Regression

- **Simple Linear Regression = SLR**

    - One X variable (IV)

- **Multiple Linear Regression = MLR**

    - 2 or more X variables (IVs)
    - MLR types include: 

         - Simultaneous: Everything at once
         - Hierarchical: IVs in steps
         - Stepwise: Statistical regression 

## Analyzing a Regression

- Is my overall model *(i.e., the regression equation)* useful at predicting the outcome variable?

    - Use the model summary, F-test, and $R^2$

- How useful are each of the individual predictors for my model?

    - Use the coefficients, t-test, and $pr^2$

## Overall Model: Understand the NHST

- Our overall model uses an *F*-test, which will be discussed more in the ANOVA section.
- However, we can think about the hypotheses for the overall test being:

    - H0: We cannot predict the dependent variable. 
    - H1: We can predict the dependent variable. 

- Generally, this form does not include one tailed tests because the math is squared, so it is impossible to get negative values in the statistical test. 

## Overall Model: Understand the NHST

- But what do we mean by predict? 
- $Y_i = b_0 + b_1X_i + \varepsilon_i$
- We are trying to predict each person's score $Y_i$ by:

    - Calculating the mean score for Y, if X = 0 $b_0$
    - Adding any influence of the predictor variables $b_1X_i$
    - Then accounting for any difference between actual $Y_i$ and predicted $\hat{Y_i}$ with error $\varepsilon_i$

## Overall Model: Understand the NHST

- The H0 or null model implies you cannot predict $Y_i$ any better than just guessing the mean for each person (top left picture).
- The H1 or alternative model implies you can predict $Y_i$ by including the predictor variables (top right picture). 
- By including the predictor variables, you are decreasing the error between actual $Y_i$ and predicted $\hat{Y_i}$.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="85%", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/7.png")
```

## Overall Model: Understand the NHST

- This math is called least squares because we are finding the equation with the least squared error.
- We use the error size to determine if our model with predictors is better than no predictors. 
- Alternatively, we can also ask if our $R^2$ value (effect size, variance explained by the model) is greater than zero (less error = higher effect size). 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/6.png")
```

## Individual Predictors: Understand the NHST

- We test the individual predictors with a t-test:
  
    - $t = \frac{b}{SE}$
    - Therefore, the model for each individual predictor is our coefficient b. 
    - Single sample t-test to determine if the b value is different from zero

## Individual Predictors: Understand the NHST

- Therefore, we might use the following hypotheses:

    - H0: X variable does not predict Y.
    - H1: X variable does predict Y. 

- Or, we could use a directional test, since the test statistic *t* can be negative:

    - H0: X variable negatively or does not predict Y (b <= 0).
    - H1: X variable positively predicts Y (b > 0).

## Individual Predictors: Understand the NHST

- Unlike correlation, these statistics are often reported with *t*(df). 
- $df = N - k - 1$

    - N = total sample size
    - k = number of predictors
    - Correlation is technically N - 1 - 1 = N - 2
    - We can also find this value in our output by looking at the *F*-statistic.

## Individual Predictors: Standardization 

- b = unstandardized regression coefficient

    - For every one unit increase in X, there will be b units increase in Y.

- $\beta$ = standardized regression coefficient

    - b in standard deviation units.
    - For every one SD increase in X, there will be $\beta$ SDs increase in Y.
    
- b or $\beta$?:

    - b is more interpretable given your specific problem
    - $\beta$ is more interpretable given differences in scales for different variables.
    
## Data Screening

- Now we want to look specifically at the residuals for Y, while screening the X variables.
- We used a random variable before to check the continuous variable (the DV) to make sure they were randomly distributed.
- Now we don't need the random variable because the residuals for Y should be randomly distributed (and evenly) with the X variable.

## Data Screening

- Accuracy
- Missing
- Outliers - (somewhat) new and exciting!
- Additivity if you have more than one predictor
- Linearity
- Normality
- Homogeneity 
- Homoscedasticity 

## Example: Mental Health

- Mental Health and Drug Use:
    
    - CESD = depression measure
    - PIL total = measure of meaning in life
    - AUDIT total = measure of alcohol use 
    - DAST total = measure of drug usage

```{r}
library(rio)
master <- import("data/regression_data.sav")
master <- master[ , c(8:11)]
str(master)
```

## Example: Accuracy, Missing Data

- All data is accurate with min and max values. 
- We only have one missing data point, which we can exclude because with only four columns, we cannot estimate missing data. 

```{r}
summary(master)
nomiss <- na.omit(master)
nrow(master)
nrow(nomiss)
```

## Example: Outliers 

- In this section, we will add a few new outlier checks:

    - Mahalanobis
    - Leverage scores
    - Cook's distance

- Because we are using regression as our model, we may consider using multiple checks before excluding outliers. 

## Example: Mahalanobis 

- The `mahalanobis()` function we have used previously.
- Since we are going to use multiple criteria, we are going to save if they are an outlier or not. 
- The table tells us: 0 (not outliers) and 1 (considered an outlier) for just Mahalanobis values.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mahal <- mahalanobis(nomiss, 
                    colMeans(nomiss), 
                    cov(nomiss))
cutmahal <- qchisq(1-.001, ncol(nomiss))
badmahal <- as.numeric(mahal > cutmahal) ##note the direction of the > 
table(badmahal)
```

## Example: Other Outliers

- To get the other outlier statistics, we have to use the regression model we wish to test. - We will use the `lm()` function with our regression formula.
- `Y ~ X + X`: Y is approximated by X plus X.
- So we will predict depression scores (CESD) with meaning, drugs, and alcohol.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model1 <- lm(CESD_total ~ PIL_total + AUDIT_TOTAL_NEW + DAST_TOTAL_NEW, 
             data = nomiss)
```

## Example: Leverage 

- **Definition** - influence of that data point on the slope
- Each score is the change in slope if you exclude that data point
- How do we calculate how much change is bad?

    - $\frac{2K+2}{N}$
    - K is the number of predictors
    - N is the sample size 

## Example: Leverage 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
k <- 3 ##number of IVs
leverage <- hatvalues(model1)
cutleverage <- (2*k+2) / nrow(nomiss)
badleverage <- as.numeric(leverage > cutleverage)
table(badleverage)
```

## Example: Cook's Distance 

- Influence **(Cook's Distance)** - a measure of how much of an effect that single case has on the whole model 
- Often described as leverage + discrepancy 
- How do we calculate how much change is bad?
  
    - $\frac{4}{N-K-1}$

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cooks <- cooks.distance(model1)
cutcooks <- 4 / (nrow(nomiss) - k - 1)
badcooks <- as.numeric(cooks > cutcooks)
table(badcooks)
```

## Example: Outliers Combined

- What do I do with all these numbers? 
- Create a total score for the number of indicators a data point has.
- You can decide what rule to use, but a suggestion is 2 or more indicators is an outlier.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
##add them up!
totalout <- badmahal + badleverage + badcooks
table(totalout)

noout <- subset(nomiss, totalout < 2)
```

## Example: Assumptions

- Now that we got rid of outliers, we need to run that model again, without the outliers.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model2 <- lm(CESD_total ~ PIL_total + AUDIT_TOTAL_NEW + DAST_TOTAL_NEW, 
             data = noout)
```

## Example: Additivity

- You want X and Y to be correlated
- You do not want the Xs to be highly correlated, as it causes you to lose power
    
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(model2, correlation = TRUE)
```

## Example: Assumption Set Up

- We use the same code as before, but without the fake regression.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
standardized <- rstudent(model2)
fitted <- scale(model2$fitted.values)
```

## Example: Linearity

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
{qqnorm(standardized)
abline(0,1)}
```

## Example: Normality

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hist(standardized)
```

## Example: Homogeneity & Homoscedasticity

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
{plot(fitted, standardized)
abline(0,0)
abline(v = 0)}
```

## Example: Assumption Alternatives

- If your assumptions go wrong:

    - Linearity - try nonlinear regression or nonparametric regression
    - Normality - more subjects, still fairly robust
    - Homogeneity/Homoscedasticity - bootstrapping 

## Example: Overall Model

- Is the overall model significant? Yes!

```{r}
summary(model2)

library(papaja)
apa_style <- apa_print(model2)
apa_style$full_result$modelfit
```

- `r apa_style$full_result$modelfit`

## Example: Predictors

```{r}
summary(model2)
```

## Example: Predictors

```{r}
apa_style$full_result$PIL_total
apa_style$full_result$AUDIT_TOTAL_NEW
apa_style$full_result$DAST_TOTAL_NEW
```

- Meaning: `r apa_style$full_result$PIL_total`
- Alcohol: `r apa_style$full_result$AUDIT_TOTAL_NEW`
- Drugs: `r apa_style$full_result$DAST_TOTAL_NEW`

## Example: Predictors

- Two concerns:

    - What if I wanted to use beta because these are very different scales?
    - What about an effect size for each individual predictor?

## Example: Beta

- You can use the `QuantPsyc` package for $\beta$ values. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(QuantPsyc)
lm.beta(model2)
```

## Example: Effect Size 

- R is the multiple correlation
- All overlap in Y, used for overall model
- $A+B+C/(A+B+C+D)$

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/19.png")
```

## Example: Effect Size 

- sr is the semipartial correlations 
- Unique contribution of IV to $R^2$ for those IVs
- Increase in proportion of explained Y variance when X is added to the equation
- $A/(A+B+C+D)$

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/19.png")
```

## Example: Effect Size 

- pr is the partial correlation
- Proportion in variance in Y not explained by other predictors but this X only
- $A/(A+D)$
- Pr > sr

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/19.png")
```

## Example: Partials

- We would add these to our other reports:

    - Meaning: `r apa_style$full_result$PIL_total`, $pr^2 = .30$
    - Alcohol: `r apa_style$full_result$AUDIT_TOTAL_NEW`, $pr^2 < .01$
    - Drugs: `r apa_style$full_result$DAST_TOTAL_NEW`, $pr^2 < .01$

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ppcor)
partials <- pcor(noout)
partials$estimate^2
```

## Example: Hierarchical Regression 

- Known predictors (based on past research) are entered into the regression model first.
- New predictors are then entered in a separate step of the model.
- You can see the unique predictive influence of a new variable on the outcome because known predictors are held constant in the model.
- Should be based on previous research, ideas, or other *a priori* decisions. 
- Statistical or stepwise regression also runs models as steps, but variables are included in the equation based on their mathematical properties. 

## Hierarchical Regression: Understand the NHST

- **Answers the following questions:**

    - Is my overall model significant?
    - Is the addition of each step significant?
    - Are the individual predictors significant?

- **Uses:**

    - When a researcher wants to control for some known variables first.
    - When a researcher wants to see the incremental value of different variables. 
    - When a researcher wants to discuss groups of variables together as a set

## Categorical Predictors

- Another unique regression issue is dealing with categorical predictors that are nominal (more than two categories).
- **Note**: all types of regression can include categorical predictors, not only hierarchical regression.
- We can use **dummy coding** to convert our variable into predictive comparisons.

    - There are several forms of effects coding: https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/spss/faq/coding-systems-for-categorical-variables-in-regression-analysis/
    - We will focus on dummy coding specifically, wherein we take the categories and create specific comparisons of the "control" versus each group separately.

## Categorical Predictors

- How do I dummy code? 
- *R* does this for you automatically, where the factored variable will be coded as comparisons, like the table below.  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/21.png")
```

## Example: Hierarchical Regression + Dummy Coding

- IVs:

    - Family history of depression
    - Treatment for depression (categorical)

- DV:

    - Rating of depression after treatment

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hdata <- import("data/dummy_code.sav")
str(hdata)
```

## Example: Hierarchical Regression + Dummy Coding

- Be sure to factor our categorical variable, or we will be treating categories as a continuous 1, 2, 3!

```{r}
attributes(hdata$treat)
hdata$treat <- factor(hdata$treat,
                     levels = 0:4,
                     labels = c("No Treatment", "Placebo", "Paxil",
                                "Effexor", "Cheerup"))
```
    
## Example: Hierarchical Regression + Dummy Coding

- Data screening should be done on the *LAST* step! (skipped here)
- Model 1: Controls for family history before testing if treatment is significant
    
    - Overall model is significant, $F(1,48) = 8.50, p = .005, R^2 = .15$
    - Family history is a significant predictor of depression rating, $b = 0.15, t(48) = 2.92, p = .005, pr^2 = .15$.  
    

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model1 <- lm(after ~ familyhistory, data = hdata)
summary(model1)
```

## Example: Hierarchical Regression + Dummy Coding

- Model 2: Examines the addition of treatment category to determine if this variable predicts depression rating after treatment. 
- Remember you have to leave in the family history variable or you aren't actually controlling for it.

    - The overall model is significant, but I'm more interested in the change between models. 
    - What if the first model was significant and then this model isn't actually any better and it's just overall significant because the first model was?

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model2 <- lm(after ~ familyhistory + treat, data = hdata)
summary(model2)
```

## Example: Hierarchical Regression + Dummy Coding

- Compare models with the `anova()` function.
- You want to show the addition of your treatment variable added significantly to the equation. 
- Basically is the change in $R^2$ > 0 ?
- The addition of the treatment set was significant: $\Delta F(4, 44) = 4.99, p = .002, \Delta R^2 = .27$

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
anova(model1, model2)
```

## Example: Hierarchical Regression + Dummy Coding

- Remember dummy coding equals:

    - Control group to coded group
    - Therefore negative numbers = coded group is lower
    - Positive numbers = coded group is higher
    - b = difference in means, controlling for other predictors 

- b values can be hard to interpret, so using `emmeans` can help us understand the results. 
- The estimated marginal means are the means for each group, given the other predictors in the model. 
    
## Example: Hierarchical Regression + Dummy Coding

```{r, echo = TRUE, out.width="75%", fig.align='left'}
summary(model2)

library(emmeans)
emmeans(model2, "treat")
```

## Example: Hierarchical Regression + Dummy Coding

- We cannot really use the `pcor` code on our categorical variables. What can we do to calculate? 
- Formula: $\frac{t^2}{t^2 + df_t}$

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model_summary <- summary(model2)
t_values <- model_summary$coefficients[ , 3] 
df_t <- model_summary$df[2]

t_values^2 / (t_values^2+df_t)
```
    
## Hierarchical Regression: Power

- We can use the `pwr` library to calculate the required sample size for any particular effect size. 
- First, we need to convert the $R^2$ value to $f^2$, which is a different effect size, not the ANOVA *F*. 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(pwr)
R2 <- model_summary$r.squared
f2 <- R2 / (1-R2)

R2
f2
```

## Hierarchical Regression: Power

- `u` is degrees of freedom for the model, first value in the F-statistic
- `v` is degrees of freedom for error, but we are trying to figure out sample size for each condition, so we leave this one blank. 
- `f2` is the converted effect size.
- `sig.level` is our $\alpha$ value
- `power` is our power level
- The final sample size is *v + k + 1 where k is the predictors*

```{r}
#f2 is cohen f squared 
pwr.f2.test(u = model_summary$df[1], 
            v = NULL, f2 = f2, 
            sig.level = .05, power = .80)
```
