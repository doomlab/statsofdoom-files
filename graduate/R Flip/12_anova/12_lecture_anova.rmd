## Comparing Means

- In the last section, we covered how to compare two means with t-tests.
- However, you can only compare two means at a time with t-tests.
- Further, you can only have one predictor variable - that's the two groups/measurements. 

## Analysis of Variance: ANOVA

- Compares several means at the same time. 
- Can be used when you have more than one independent variable
- ANOVA is also a special form of regression, often called the general linear model. 

## Why not use t-Tests?

- If we want to compare three or more means why don't we compare pairs of means with t-tests?

    - Cannot examine several independent variables.
    - Inflates the Type I error rate.
    
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/1.png")
```

## Type I Error 

- Formula = $1 - (1-\alpha)^c$

    - Alpha = type I error rate = .05 usually *(that's why the last slide had .95)*
    - C = number of comparisons

- Therefore, if you have:

    - Three groups - three comparisons = `r round(1-(1-.05)^3, 3)`
    - Four groups - six comparisons = `r round(1-(1-.05)^6, 3)`
    - Five groups - ten comparisons = `r round(1-(1-.05)^10, 3)`

## Regression v ANOVA

- ANOVA in Regression:

    - Used to assess whether the regression model is good at predicting an outcome.

- ANOVA in Experiments:

    - Used to see whether experimental manipulations lead to differences in performance on an outcome (DV).
    - By manipulating a predictor variable can we cause (and therefore predict) a change in behavior?

- Actually can be the same question!

## ANOVA: Understanding the NHST

- H0: There are no differences in means.
- H1: There are differences in the means.
- ANOVA is an Omnibus test

    - It test for an overall difference between groups.
    - It tells us that the group means are different.
    - It doesn't tell us exactly which means differ.
    
## ANOVA: Understanding the NHST

- We compare the amount of variability explained by the Model *(experiment)*, to the error in the model *(individual differences)*
- This ratio is called the F-ratio.
- If the model explains a lot more variability than it can't explain, then the experimental manipulation has had a significant effect on the outcome *(DV)*.

## ANOVA: F-ratio

- Variance created by our manipulation *(IV levels)*

    - Good variance *(systematic variance)*

- Variance created by unknown factors

    - Bad variance *(unsystematic variance)*

## ANOVA: F-ratio

- We calculate how much variability there is between scores: total sum of squares $SS_T$. This value is then divided into: 
  
    - We then calculate how much of this variability can be explained by the model we fit to the data: model sum of squares $SS_M$
    - How much cannot be explained: residual sum of squares $SS_R$

- If the experiment is successful, then the model will explain more variance than it can't after accounting for differences in group sizes in these calculations

## ANOVA: Example

- Testing the effects of Viagra on Libido using three groups:

    - Placebo (Sugar Pill)
    - Low Dose Viagra
    - High Dose Viagra

- The Outcome/Dependent Variable (DV) was an objective measure of Libido.

## The Data

```{r message=FALSE}
library(rio)
master <- import("data/viagra.sav")
str(master)
master$dose <- factor(master$dose, 
                      levels = c(1,2,3),
                      labels = c("Placebo", "Low Dose", "High Dose"))
```

## Calculate $SS_T$

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/4.png")
```

## Visualize $SS_T$:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/5.png")
```

## $SS_T$ df 

- Degrees of Freedom (df) are the number of values that are free to vary.
- In general, the df are one less than the number of values used to calculate the SS.

    - $df_T$ = (N-1) = 15-1 = 14
    
## Calculate $SS_M$

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/6.png")
```

## Visualize $SS_M$

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/7.png")
```

## $SS_M$ df

- How many values did we use to calculate $SS_M$?

    - We used the 3 means (levels).
    - $df_M$ = (k-1) = 3-1 = 2
    
## Calculate $SS_R$

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/8.png")
```

## Visualize $SS_R$

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/9.png")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/10.png")
```

## $SS_R$ df

- How many values did we use to calculate $SS_R$?

    - We used the 5 scores for each of the SS for each group.
    
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/11.png")
```

## Double Check

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/12.png")
```

## Calculate Mean Squared Error

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/13.png")
```

## Calculate the F-Ratio

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/14.png")
```

## Construct a Summary Table

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/15.png")
```

## F-values

- Since all these formulas are based on variances, the *F*-statistic is never negative.
- Think about the logic of model divided by error: 

    - If your values are small you are saying model = error = just a bunch of noise because people are different
    - If your values are large then model > error, which means you are finding an effect.

## Assumptions

- Data screening: accuracy, missing, outliers
- Normality 
- Linearity *(it is called the general linear model!)*
- Homogeneity - Levene's *(new!)*
- Homoscedasticity *(still a form of regression)*
- **Note:** You can do the normal screening we've already done and add Levene's test.

## Assumptions

- ANOVA is often called a "robust test"
- Robustness is the ability to still give you accurate results even though the assumptions are not quite met.

    - Tests are robust with equal sample sizes in groups
    - When sample sizes are sufficiently large
    
## Assumptions

- Levene's Test

    - Levene's test is an ANOVA using variances as a testing point, instead of the means. 
    - Tells you if variances are equal across groups. 
    - You DO NOT want this test to be significant, and remember our data screening $\alpha$, p < .001 is bad. 
    
## ANOVA: Analysis

- We are going to use the `ezANOVA` function in the `ez` library. This package can analyze many types of ANOVA, run the assumption tests, and give you effect size all at once.
- First, you must add a participant number if you do not already have one in the dataset.

    - It is advantageous to wait to add one until the end of data screening (or you would need to drop that column for every assumption test). 
    - Also make sure the IV is factored, or it will not give you Levene's test.
    
## ANOVA: Analysis

- You will get a warning - just ignore it: "Warning converting partno to a factor for ANOVA". 

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(ez)

## you must have a participant number for ezANOVA
master$partno <- 1:nrow(master)
options(scipen = 20)
ezANOVA(data = master,
        dv = libido,
        between = dose,
        wid = partno,
        type = 3, 
        detailed = T)
```

## ANOVA: Levene's

- Levene's test is not significant, $F(2,12) = 0.12, p = .890$

```{r echo = T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ezANOVA(data = master,
        dv = libido,
        between = dose,
        wid = partno,
        type = 3, 
        detailed = T)$`Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance`
```

## ANOVA: Levene's

- What do you do if homogeneity test was significant? *(Levene's)*
- Run a Welch correction on the ANOVA using the oneway function.

```{r}
## running a one way anova - if Levene's Test is significant
oneway.test(libido ~ dose, data = master)
```

## ANOVA: F-Statistic

- There was a significant effect of Viagra on levels of libido, $F(2, 12) = 5.12, p = .025, \eta^2= .46$

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ezANOVA(data = master,
        dv = libido,
        between = dose,
        wid = partno,
        type = 3, 
        detailed = T)$ANOVA
```

## ANOVA: Effect Size

- In ANOVA, there are two effect sizes - one for the overall *(omnibus)* test and one for the follow up tests *(coming next)*.

- F-test
      
    - $R^2$ or $\eta^2$ or $ges^2$ 
    - $\omega^2$
    
## ANOVA: Effect Size

- Proportion of variability accounted for by an effect
- Useful when you have more than two means, gives you the total good variance with 3+ means
- Can only be positive
- Range from .00 - 1.00
- Small = .01, medium = .06, large = .15

## ANOVA: Effect Size

- $R^2$ - more traditionally listed with regression
- $\eta^2$ - more traditionally listed with ANOVA
- $ges^2$ - a newer effect size suggested to correct for ANOVA overestimation
- These are all equal in a one-way between subjects ANOVA
- $\frac{SS_M}{SS_T}$

## ANOVA: Effect Size

- $\omega^2$ is a suggested correction for the overestimation of the other statistics
- Omega squared is an $R^2$ style effect size *(variance accounted for)* that estimates effect size on population parameters 
- $\frac{SS_M - df_M \times MS_R}{SS_T + MS_R}$

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(MOTE)
effect <- omega.F(dfm = 2, #this is dfn in the anova
                  dfe = 12, #this is dfd in the anova
                  Fvalue = 5.12, #this is F
                  n = 15, #look at the number of rows in your dataset
                  a = .05) #leave this as .05
effect$omega
```

## Post Hocs and Trends: Why Use Follow-Up Tests?

- The F-ratio tells us only that the experiment was successful, and group means were different.
- It does not tell us specifically which group means differ from which.
- We need additional tests to find out where the group differences lie.

## Post Hocs and Trends: How?

- Multiple t-tests

    - We saw earlier that this path is a bad idea for type I error

- Orthogonal Contrasts/Comparisons

    - Hypothesis driven
    - Planned a priori

- Post Hoc Tests

    - Not Planned (a posteriori)
    - Compare all pairs of means
    - But this is just a bunch of t-tests, so we have to correct for type I error issues

- Trend Analysis

## Post Hoc Tests

- Compare each mean against all others.
- In general terms they use a stricter criterion to accept an effect as significant.
- TEST = t.test or F.test
- CORRECTION = None, Bonferroni(*), Tukey, SNK, Scheffe

## Post Hoc Tests

- For all of these post hocs, we are going to use t-test to calculate the if the differences between means is significant.
- We are going to run the Bonferroni and compare to no correction to talk about how these corrections work. 

## Post Hoc Tests: Bonferroni

- Restricted sets of contrasts - these tests are better with smaller families of hypotheses *(i.e. less comparisons)*.
- These tests adjust the required *p* value needed for significance. 
- Bonferroni - the overall $\alpha$ error rate is related to the number of comparisons
- Therefore, it's easy to correct for the problem by dividing alpha by c to control where the new $\alpha$ = $\frac{\alpha}{c}$
- The output you see has corrected the *p* value to account for this new $\alpha$, so you can remember your old cut off score. 
- Other types of restricted contrasts:

    - Sidak-Bonferroni
    - Holm
    - Dunnett's test
    
## Post Hoc Tests: Comparison

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## post hoc tests - p.value adjustment "none"
pairwise.t.test(master$libido,
                master$dose,
                p.adjust.method = "none", 
                paired = F, 
                var.equal = T)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/16.png")
```

## Post Hoc Tests: Bonferroni

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## post hoc tests - p.value adjustment "bonferroni"
pairwise.t.test(master$libido,
                master$dose,
                p.adjust.method = "bonferroni", 
                paired = F, 
                var.equal = T)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/17.png")
```

## Post Hoc Tests: Effect Size

- Because we have calculated every pairwise combination, we can use $d_s$ to calculate the effect sizes for each combination.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/18.png")
```

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## get numbers for effect size
M <- tapply(master$libido, master$dose, mean)
N <- tapply(master$libido, master$dose, length)
STDEV <- tapply(master$libido, master$dose, sd)

## placebo to low
effect1 <- d.ind.t(m1 = M[1], m2 = M[2],
                 sd1 = STDEV[1], sd2 = STDEV[2],
                 n1 = N[1], n2 = N[2], a = .05)
effect1$d

## placebo to high
effect2 = d.ind.t(m1 = M[1], m2 = M[3],
                 sd1 = STDEV[1], sd2 = STDEV[3],
                 n1 = N[1], n2 = N[3], a = .05)
effect2$d

## low to high
effect3 = d.ind.t(m1 = M[2], m2 = M[3],
                  sd1 = STDEV[2], sd2 = STDEV[3],
                  n1 = N[2], n2 = N[3], a = .05)
effect3$d
```

## ANOVA: Visualization

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

cleanup <- theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
                panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
                panel.background = element_blank(), 
                axis.line.x = element_line(color = "black"),
                axis.line.y = element_line(color = "black"),
                legend.key = element_rect(fill = "white"),
                text = element_text(size = 15))

bargraph <- ggplot(master, aes(dose, libido))
bargraph +
  cleanup +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, 
               geom = "bar", 
               fill = "White", 
               color = "Black") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, 
               geom = "errorbar", 
               width = .2, 
               position = "dodge") +
  xlab("Dosage of Drug") +
  ylab("Average Libido")
```

## Trend Analysis

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pictures/19.png")
```

## Trend Analysis

- Quadratic Trend = a curve across levels
- Cubic Trend = two changes in direction of trend
- Quartic Trend = three changes in direction of trend
- These analyses only make sense with a somewhat "continuous" IV

## Trend Analysis

- There was a significant linear trend, $t(12) = 3.16, p = .008, R^2 = .46$, indicating that as the dose of Viagra increased, libido increased as well.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## trend analysis
k = 3 ## set to the number of groups
master$dose2 <- master$dose #this changes the variable
contrasts(master$dose2) <- contr.poly(k) ## note this does change the original dataset
output <- aov(libido ~ dose2, data = master)
summary.lm(output)
```

## Trend Analysis: Visualization

```{r echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
doseline <- ggplot(master, aes(dose2, libido))
doseline +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, ## adds the points
               geom = "point") +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, ## adds the line
               geom = "line",
               aes(group=1)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, ## adds the error bars
               geom = "errorbar", 
               width = .2) +
  xlab("Dose of Viagra") +
  ylab("Average Libido") + 
  cleanup
```

## Power: One Way Between Subjects

- We used $f^2$ for regression, however, this analysis uses $f$.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(pwr)
eta = .46
f_eta = sqrt(eta / (1-eta))

pwr.anova.test(k = 3, #levels 
               n = NULL, #leave to get sample size per group
               f = f_eta, #f from eta
               sig.level = .05, #alpha
               power = .80) #power
```
