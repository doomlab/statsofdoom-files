## Language Topics Discussed

- A reanalysis of color terms and categories

```{r}
##r chunk
library(reticulate)
py_config()
#py_install("prince")
```

## Basic Color Terms

- Berlin and Kay (1969) proposed a theory about our linguistic interpretations of colors, mainly that color vocabulary falls into universal categories:

```{r berlinkay, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("berlinkay.png")
```

## Simple Correspondence Analysis

- Data is from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA)
- Counts of adjective use of color terms

```{r}
##r chunk
library(Rling)
data(colreg)
head(colreg)
```

## Chi-square

- Chi-square analyses tell us if specific category frequencies are different than we might expect.
- Let's look at a simple combination to understand the math behind chi-square.

```{r}
##r chunk
cs_example = colreg[1:2, 1:2]
cs_example
```

## Expected values

$$E = \frac{Row*Column}{N}$$

```{r}
##r chunk
cs_example_e = cs_example
rows = rowSums(cs_example)
columns = colSums(cs_example)

cs_example_e[1,1] = rows[1]*columns[1]/sum(cs_example)
cs_example_e[1,2] = rows[1]*columns[2]/sum(cs_example)
cs_example_e[2,1] = rows[2]*columns[1]/sum(cs_example)
cs_example_e[2,2] = rows[2]*columns[2]/sum(cs_example)
cs_example_e
```

## Using chisq.test

```{r}
##r chunk
cs_test = chisq.test(cs_example)
cs_test$expected
cs_example
```

## Chi-square Formula

$$\chi^2 = \Sigma \frac{(O-E)^2}{E}$$
```{r}
##r chunk
sum((cs_example - cs_example_e)^2 / cs_example_e)
cs_test$statistic
```

## Chi-Square - What Next?

- This test doesn't tell you *what* was different though, much like ANOVA
- The way to know what cells were higher/lower than expected would be to use standardized residuals

## Residuals 

- Residuals are (O-E)/sqrt(E), whereas standardized residuals are standardized format akin to z-scores (O-E)/ sqrt(var(residuals))

```{r}
##r chunk
cs_test$residuals #(cs_example - cs_example_e) /sqrt(cs_example_e)
cs_test$stdres
```

## Mosaic Plots

- A visualization of the standardized residuals from a chi-square type analysis
- The box size is related to the observed cell size 
- Coloring is shaded based on direction and strength of the residuals

## Mosaic Plots - Small Example

```{r}
##r chunk
mosaicplot(colreg[1:2, 1:2], #data frame
           las = 2, #axis label style (perpendicular)
           shade = T, #color in the boxes
           main = "Register Variation")
```

## Mosaic Plot - Full Data

```{r}
##r chunk
mosaicplot(colreg, #data frame
           las = 2, #axis label style (perpendicular)
           shade = T, #color in the boxes
           main = "Register Variation")
```

## Simple Correspondence Analysis 

- Identifies systematic relationships between variables in low dimensional space
- Similar to MDS, PCA, EFA

```{r}
##r chunk
library(ca)
sca_model = ca(colreg)
```

## What's in the output?

```{r}
##r chunk
summary(sca_model)
```

## Inertia

- Top part is the table of inertias, which explain how much variation is accounted for by each dimension
- These are similar to eigenvalues that we've seen in the last several analyses 

## Inertia

- Try to represent the relationship between variables in as few dimensions as possible
- Here we see that the first two dimensions capture 97% of the variance
- And the third dimension captures all the variance 

Principal inertias (eigenvalues):

 dim    value      %   cum%   scree plot               
 1      0.043730  77.9  77.9  *******************      
 2      0.010787  19.2  97.1  *****                    
 3      0.001650   2.9 100.0  *                        
        -------- -----                                 
 Total: 0.056167 100.0   
 
## Visualize the Dimensions

```{r}
##r chunk
plot(sca_model)
```

## Key Differences

- How are these plots different than the ones we've been making?
  - Terms are close together if they have similar frequency counts
  - This means the rows have similar *profiles* - rather than similar relationships to a latent variable 
  - The distances on the map are a representation of the $\chi^2$ values of each row/column to the average profile
  
## Does this match theory?

```{r berlinkay2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("berlinkay.png")

plot(sca_model)
```

## Some other interesting notes

- Press is close to green-red because of the political orientation for these terms and proper names (Red Cross/Green Bay Packers)
- Fiction is likely close to the later color terms because of the requirement to "paint a picture" for readers
- Appears academics and spoken speech are pretty boring in their use of color terms

## How do we analyze CA in Python?

```{python}
##python chunk
import prince
col_reg = r.colreg #convert the data over from R

ca = prince.CA( ##set up the ca model 
    n_components=2,
    n_iter=3,
    copy=True,
    check_input=True,
    engine='auto',
    random_state=42)
    
ca = ca.fit(col_reg) #run the ca model 

ca.explained_inertia_ #get the inertias
```

## How do we graph CA in Python? 

```{python}
##python chunk
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')
ax = ca.plot_coordinates(
    X=col_reg,
    ax=None,
    figsize=(6, 6),
    x_component=0,
    y_component=1,
    show_row_labels=True,
    show_col_labels=True
)
ax.get_figure()
```

## 3D Plots in R

```{r}
##r chunk
plot3d.ca(sca_model, #model
       labels = c(1,1)) #see both row and column labels
```

## A Category Example

- Is there a difference between the categories for *stuhl* (chair) and *sessel* (armchair)?
- Gipper (1959) had subjects name pictures of chairs to determine their relative frequencies
- The difference appeared to be that chairs are functional, while armchairs are about comfort

## The Data

- Data was coded from an online shopping place based on their text descriptions and other chair related variables 

```{r}
##r chunk
data(chairs)
head(chairs)
```

## Multiple Correspondence Analysis

```{r}
##r chunk
library(FactoMineR)
mca_model = MCA(chairs[ , -c(1:3)], #dataset minus the first columns
                graph = FALSE)
summary(mca_model)
```

## Plot the MCA

```{r}
##r chunk
plot(mca_model, cex = .7, 
     col.var = "black",  #color the variable names
     col.ind = "gray")
    # invis = "ind") #color the indicators
```

## How Useful are the Variables?

```{r}
##r chunk
dimdesc(mca_model)
```

## Interpretation

- $R^2$ values representing the variables association with the dimension
- $p$ value strength of that association
- Then the `$category` section represents the directionality of the relationship
  - If this value is positive, shows on the right hand side of plot, representing a positive coefficient (and vice versa)
  
## Overall interpretation

- First dimension seems to represent comfort chairs versus not
- Second dimensions seems to represent functionality (work versus home)
- Third is harder to understand 
- Appears to separate chairs into three categories:
  - Comfortable relaxation chairs
  - Comfortable adjustable chairs for work
  - Multifunctional chairs for the house

## Using the chair label

- We did not use the type of chair that is found in column 3 of our dataset
- We can map it onto our analysis using it as a supplementary variable 

## Running that analysis

```{r}
##r chunk
mca_model2 = MCA(chairs[ , -c(1,2)], 
                 quali.sup = 1, #supplemental variable
                 graph = FALSE)
```

## Plot that analysis

```{r}
##r chunk
plot(mca_model2, invis = "ind", col.var = "darkgray", col.quali.sup = "black")
#the invis turned off the individual points
```

## Examine the prototypes

```{r}
##r chunk
plotellipses(mca_model2, keepvar = 1, #use column 1 to label
             label = "quali")
```

## Interpretation

- These confidence ellipses do not overlap, so we could consider the prototypes distinct entities 
- We can also create a more traditional 95% CI type interval

## 95% Ellipses 

- Now you can see that the categories themselves overlap a lot, so likely a representation of the fuzzy boundaries that categories appear to have. 

```{r}
##r chunk
plotellipses(mca_model2, 
             means = F,
             keepvar = 1, #use column 1 to label
             label = "quali")
```

## The plot

```{r graph2, echo = F}
##r chunk
plotellipses(mca_model2, 
             means = F,
             keepvar = 1, #use column 1 to label
             label = "quali")
```

## But what about inertia? 

```{r}
##r chunk
mca_model2$eig
```

## Inertia part 2

```{r}
##r chunk
mca_model3 = mjca(chairs[ , -c(1:3)])
summary(mca_model3)
```

## MCA in Python

```{python, message = F,  warning = F}
##python chunk
mca = prince.MCA( ##set up the mca analysis
    n_components=2,
    n_iter=3,
    copy=True,
    check_input=True,
    engine='auto',
    random_state=42)
    
chairs = r.chairs
chairs = chairs.drop(['Shop', 'WordDE', 'Category'], axis=1)
mca = mca.fit(chairs)
mca.explained_inertia_
```

## Plot MCA in Python

```{python}
##python chunk
ax = mca.plot_coordinates(
    X=chairs,
    ax=None,
    figsize=(6, 6),
    show_row_points=True,
    row_points_size=10,
    show_row_labels=False,
    show_column_points=True,
    column_points_size=30,
    show_column_labels=False,
    legend_n_cols=1
)
ax.get_figure()
```

## Further work

- From here, you could take the dimension scores `mca_model2$ind$coord` and use them to predict the categories or other variables
- This analysis would tell you how good at representing their categories each dimension does 

## Summary

- We applied new models to basic color terms and category groupings
- We learned how to do simple and multiple correspondence analysis
