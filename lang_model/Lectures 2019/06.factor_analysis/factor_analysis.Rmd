## Language Topics Discussed

- Registers as an extension of dialect and other cultural norms
- The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) will be used for the assignment 

## Registers?

- A register is a language variety associated with the way you are using the language (i.e., email versus face-to-face)
- Contextual factors that change registers:
  - Communication channel: writing, speech
  - Relationship between participants: personal, work, status
  - Communication purpose: social, transfer of information
  - Setting: Private, public

## Registers are linguistic

- Registers can also be related to specific linguistic features
  - So we may see more first person pronouns in person than through email 
  - We can use clustering to understand these conversations and give them labels without hand coding it

## Biber's work 

- Biber (1988) used factor analysis to analyze conversations for different register variations
  - Showed dimensions such as:
    - Involved/Informal Production
    - Narrative/Non-narrative contexts

## Relation to previous work 

- These variations are obviously related to each other, rather than being distinct categories that we can cleanly separate
- This sort of overlap does make defining register difficult, but the general categories remain
- The idea of register is often tied to genre, stylistic choices, jargon, dialect (as defined last week)
- Sometimes defined as pragmatics - the social use of language

## Thinking about formality

- Register can be considered a ranking of formality (tenor), if we think about it in a social way 
  - Frozen: "static" text, like the Pledge of Allegiance
  - Formal: one way conversation aimed at delivering technical knowledge, like a conference presentation 
  - Consultative: two way conversation with some formality usually delivering knowledge, like student/teacher 
  - Casual: friends/acquaintances, slang, social settings 
  - Intimate: family, close friends, non-verbal messages, non-public

## Analyzing register

- We will look at the British National Corpus which has been coded for:
  - 69 observations of 11 variables
  - Things like: `Ncomm`: frequencies of common nouns, `Vpres`: frequencies of third present tense verbs, `P1`: first person pronouns, `ConjCoord`: coordinating conjunctions, etc. 

## Let's look at the data
  
```{r}
##r chunk 
library(reticulate)
library(Rling)
library(psych)
data(reg_bnc)
head(reg_bnc)
```

```{python}
##python chunk

#open library
import pandas as pd

#move over data from R or import it with pd.read_csv
reg_bnc_py = r.reg_bnc

#look at the data
reg_bnc_py.head()

#get rid of extra columns we don't need 
reg_bnc_py.drop(['Reg'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
```

## A brief note

- PCA: components are orthogonal (i.e. uncorrelated) linear combinations that maximize capturing the total variance
  - Often used when you want separate distinction solutions, clustering things together, dimensionality reduction 
  - Components are not interpretable
- EFA: factors are linear combinations that maximize the shared portions of the variance 
  - Often used when you want to identify the underlying "latent" variables, allowing them to be correlated to each other 
  - Factors are interpretable and labelable 
- We are going to focus on EFA in this analysis!

## Steps to Analysis

- Things to check before you begin
- How many factors should you use?
- Simple structure
- Adequate solutions

## Before you begin

  - Check correlations - you want things to be correlated, `cortest.bartlett`
  - Check your sampling adequacy, `KMO`
  - At least 3-4 items per grouping
  - Interval measurement
  - Normal/linear/normal parametric assumptions

## Correlations 

- If non-significant implies that your items are not correlated enough

```{r}
##r chunk 
correlations <- cor(reg_bnc[ , -1 ])
cortest.bartlett(correlations, n = nrow(reg_bnc)) 
```

## Correlations - Python

- If you see a `TypeError: Series cannot perform the operation -`: you have tried to pass character columns to the correlation matrix, which does not work. 

```{python}
##python chunk

#import bartlett test
from factor_analyzer.factor_analyzer import calculate_bartlett_sphericity

#calculate bartlett
chi_square_value, p_value = calculate_bartlett_sphericity(reg_bnc_py)

#output the answer
chi_square_value, p_value
```

## Sampling adequacy

- Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test
- Compares the ratio between $r^2$ and $pr^2$
- Scores closer to 1 are better, closer to 0 are bad

## Sampling adequacy

```{r}
##r chunk 
KMO(correlations)
```

```{python}
##python chunk
from factor_analyzer.factor_analyzer import calculate_kmo
kmo_all,kmo_model=calculate_kmo(reg_bnc_py)

#for each variable one at a time
kmo_all

#for the entire set
kmo_model
```

## How many factors do I use?

- Theory
- Kaiser criterion
- Scree plots
- Parallel analysis

## Kaiser criterion

- Old rule: extract the number of eigenvalues over 1
- New rule: extract the number of eigenvalues over .7
- What the heck is an eigenvalue? 
  - A mathematical representation of the variance accounted for by that grouping of items

## Scree plots

```{r scree, echo=FALSE, out.height="500px", out.width="800px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("scree.png")
```

## Parallel analysis

- A statistical test to tell you how many eigenvalues are greater than chance
  - Calculates the eigenvalues for your data
  - Randomizes your data and recalculates the eigenvalues
  - Then compares them to determine if they are equal

## Finding factors/components

```{r}
##r chunk 
number_items <- fa.parallel(reg_bnc[, -1], ##dataset
                           fm = "ml", ##type of math
                           fa = "both") #look at both efa/pca
```

## Finding factors/components - Python

```{python}
##python chunk
#save factor analysis function
from factor_analyzer import FactorAnalyzer
fa = FactorAnalyzer(n_factors = len(reg_bnc_py.columns),
                    rotation = None)

#run an analysis just to get the eigenvalues
fa.fit(reg_bnc_py)

#view the eigenvalues
ev, v = fa.get_eigenvalues()
ev
```

## Scree Plots - Python

```{python}
##python chunk
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(range(1,reg_bnc_py.shape[1]+1),ev)
plt.plot(range(1,reg_bnc_py.shape[1]+1),ev)
plt.title('Scree Plot')
plt.xlabel('Factors')
plt.ylabel('Eigenvalue')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

## Eigenvalues

```{r}
##r chunk 
sum(number_items$fa.values > 1)
sum(number_items$fa.values > .7)
```

```{python}
##python chunk
sum(ev > 1)
sum(ev > .7)
```

## Simple structure

- Simple structure covers two pieces:
  - The math used to achieve the solution
    - PCA: principle components
    - EFA: maximum likelihood
  - The rotation to increase communality between items and aid in interpretation (EFA only)
  
## Rotation

```{r rotation, echo=FALSE, out.height="500px", out.width="800px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("rotate.png")
```

## Rotation
  
- Orthogonal assume uncorrelated factors: varimax, quartermax, equamax
- Oblique allows factors to be correlated: oblimin, promax
- Why would we even use orthogonal?

## Simple structure/solution

- Looking at the loadings: the relationship between the item and the factor/component
  - Want these to be related at least .3 
  - Remember that r = .3 is a medium effect size that is ~10% variance
  - Can eliminate items that load poorly 
  - Difference here in scale development versus exploratory clustering

## Run an EFA

```{r}
##r chunk 
EFA_fit <- fa(reg_bnc[, -1], #data
             nfactors = 2, #number of factors
             rotate = "oblimin", #rotation
             fm = "ml") #math
```

```{python}
##python chunk
fa = FactorAnalyzer(n_factors = 2, rotation = "oblimin")
fa.fit(reg_bnc_py)
```


## Look at the results

```{r}
##r chunk 
EFA_fit$loadings #look at the full results
EFA_fit
```

## Look at the results - Python

```{python}
##python chunk
fa.loadings_ #notice underscore 

fa.get_factor_variance() ##ss, prop, cumulative
```

## Plots of the results

- For two factor models, we could also use `matplotlib` to scatterplot the loadings, creating essentially this picture. 
- The built in plot fuctions from `psych` are fantastic!

```{r}
##r chunk 
fa.plot(EFA_fit, 
     labels = colnames(reg_bnc[ , -1]))
```

## Plots of the results

```{r}
##r chunk 
fa.diagram(EFA_fit)
#black only related to one side, red it picked a side
```

## Adequate solution

- Fit indices: a measure of how well the model matches the data 
  - Goodness of fit statistics: measure the overlap between the reproduced correlation matrix and the original, want high numbers close to 1
  - Badness of fit statistics (residual): measure the mismatch, want low numbers close to zero 
- Theory/interpretability 

## Fit statistics

- Python does not provide these in this package. 

```{r}
##r chunk 
EFA_fit$rms #Root mean square of the residuals
EFA_fit$RMSEA #root mean squared error of approximation
EFA_fit$TLI #tucker lewis index
```

## Summary

- You learned about registers and how they can be used to classify language
- You learned how to examine how these group together into orthogonal components versus latent factors
- You learned about EFA and PCA and the steps to running them
