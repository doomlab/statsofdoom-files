## Language Topics Discussed

- English Lexicon Project
- The Subtitle Projects
- Extension to Priming Projects

## English Lexicon Project

- http://elexicon.wustl.edu/
- ELP was a large undertaking that helped kick start the recent uptick in standardized behavioral data for language researchers
  - Corpora have been around, so have databases, but in the last 10 years, this field has grown exponentially
- The data contains 40K + words and 40K + nonwords with many characteristics
- Lexical Decision and Naming Tasks included

## English Lexicon Project 

- https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/ldt.html
  - However, you would only see one word at a time (in this example you see two)
- In the naming task, you would be asked to read those words aloud, one at a time
- Output we are interested in is how the lexical variables might predict the response latencies

## Subtitle Projects

- Starting with Brysbaert and New (several papers), there was a movement to rethink frequency and its relation to predicting language results
- Traditionally, two sources of frequency were used:
  - The Brown Corpus: Kucera and Francis (1967)
  - HAL Corpus: Burgess and Livesay (1998) 
- However, we weren't sure these were the best estimators of frequency

## Subtitle Projects

- http://subtlexus.lexique.org/
- Downloaded subtitles from www.opensubtitles.org with 50 million words+
- Provided both estimates for subtitles and music lyrics
- Models estimating lexical decision and naming times indicate these estimations of frequency are better predictors
- Expanded to 15-20 different languages 

## The Semantic Priming Project

- Priming occurs when cognitive processing is speeded because of a previous event
- Generally, we measure priming using lexical decision and naming tasks
- Let's say you have two trials:
  - DOCTOR --> TREE (unrelated)
  - DOCTOR --> NURSE (related)

## The Semantic Priming Project

- Priming is thought to occur by several different mechanisms: spreading activation, deliberate cognitive processes such as expectancy generation, etc.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="300px", out.width="300px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("spread.png")
```

## The Semantic Priming Project

- Contains lexical decision and naming response latencies for related, unrelated, and nonword trials
- Is paired with the ELP and SUBTLEX projects
- Gives us more data to predict either response latencies or priming latencies

## Regression

- Simple regression is the relationship between one independent and one dependent variable (also correlation)
- Multiple regression is the relationship between two or more independent variables and one dependent variable
  - Useful because it allows you to examine the predictive ability of each variable adjusting for the other variables
- We can fit parametric (linear) models or nonparametric models, depending on the expectation of linearity, as well as the type of dependent variable

## Understand Regression Models

$${\hat{y_i}} = b_0 + b_1x_{1i} + b_2x_{2i} ... + \epsilon_i$$

- Y-hat is the predicted score for each person (i) on the dependent variable
- B-zero is the y-intercept 
- B-1+ are the slope values for each predictor
  - Slopes are interpreted as *for every one unit increase in X, we see B unit increases in Y*
- X is each individual predictor 
- Error for each individual person, as we never get their predicted score exactly right

## Understand Regression Models

- Least Squares estimation 
  - Creates the line of best fit by minimizing the residual error $\epsilon$

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="400px", out.width="400px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("regress.png")
```

## Understand Regression Models

- For the overall model including all variables:
  - Determine statistical significance by using *p* values from an *F*-test for linear models
  - Determine practical significance by using $R^2$ 
- For the individual predictors:
  - Determine statistical significance by using *p* values from a *t*-test
  - Determine practical significance by using partial correlation $pr^2$

## Examples Using ELP

- Word is the word presented to the participant 
- Length is the number of characters in each word
- SUBTLWF is the subtitle word frequency estimate
- POS is part of speech
- Mean_RT is the mean response latency in milliseconds

```{r libraries, echo = T}
library(Rling)
data(ELP)
head(ELP)
```

## Dealing with Categorical Predictors

- How can we interpret and use categorical predictors?
- When X is continuous, the interpretation is that *for every one unit increase in X, we see B unit increases in Y*
- That doesn't work as well for categorical predictors...
- Instead, we have to use Dummy Coding (well, *R* does it for us)

## Dummy Coding 

- A way to represent categorical data for regression/least squares analyses
- You will get (categories - 1) predictors
- How to interpret these predictors?
  - Each predictor represents the difference in means between the coded group (the one with the 1) and the group coded as all zeroes (the "control" group)

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("dummy.jpg")
```

## Dummy Coding

- POS is a categorical predictor we want to use
- Three categories: 
  - JJ: Adjective
  - NN: Noun
  - VB: Verb
- Default is to make the first category the comparison category

```{r pos, echo = T}
table(ELP$POS)
```

## Dummy Coding

- Generally, nouns would be considered the comparison group, so let's rearrange them so they are "first". 
```{r pos2, echo = T}
ELP$POS <- factor(ELP$POS, #the column you want to update
                 #the values in the data in the order you want
                 levels = c("NN", "JJ", "VB"), 
                 #give them better labels if you want
                 labels = c("Noun", "Adjective", "Verb")) 
table(ELP$POS)
```

## Dealing with Non-Normal Data

- One issue in language research is that often we have non-normal data
- Especially when working with frequency (as it is distributed by Zipf's law)

## Dealing with Non-Normal Data

```{r freq, echo = T}
hist(ELP$SUBTLWF, breaks = 100)
```

## Dealing with Non-Normal Data

- The simplest solution is to take the `log` of the variable.
- Does make interpretation a bit more difficult, but helps with the distribution of the data. 

## Dealing with Non-Normal Data

```{r freq2, echo = T}
ELP$Log_SUB <- log(ELP$SUBTLWF)
hist(ELP$Log_SUB)
```

## Build the Linear Model

- To be able to use our output for several purposes, we want to save it 
  - You can call it whatever you want, I like `model`.
- Format for `lm` function is:
  - Y ~ X + X + ...
  - data = name of data frame

```{r lm, echo = T}
model <- lm(Mean_RT ~ Length + Log_SUB + POS,
           data = ELP)
```

## Summarize the Linear Model

```{r lm2, echo = T}
summary(model)
```

## Residuals

- A summary of the residuals - remember that residuals are the error terms or how far off we were at predicting the Mean_RT
- We will use this information as part of our assumptions diagnostics for data screening

```{r lm3, echo = T}
summary(model$residuals)
```

## Coefficients

- The coefficients table shows you the individual predictor significance levels
- If you use *p* < .05 as a criterion, we see that:
  - Intercept is the average RL
  - Length is a positive predictor: long words take longer to react to 
  - Frequency is a negative predictor: more frequent words are faster (i.e. low freq = high RL)
  - Adjectives and Nouns have the same RL
  - Verbs and Nouns have different RL

## Coefficients

```{r lm4, echo = T}
options(scipen = 999)
round(summary(model)$coefficients, 3)
```

## Coefficients

- To interpret categorical predictors, it can help to make a means table
- Now I can see that verbs are responded to faster than nouns, interpreting the categorical predictor

```{r tapply, echo = T}
tapply(ELP$Mean_RT, #dv 
       ELP$POS, #iv group variable
       mean) #function 
```

## Coefficient Confidence Intervals 

- We can calculate the confidence intervals for the coefficients, to help understand their precision

```{r ci_coef, echo = T}
confint(model)
```

## Coefficient Practical Importance

- Calculate $pr^2$: variance accounted for in the DV by that IV after removing all variance due to other IVs

$$ \frac{t_{x_i}}{\sqrt{t_{x_i}^2 + df_{res}}} $$
```{r prs, echo = T}
t <- summary(model)$coefficients[-1 , 3]
pr <- t / sqrt(t^2 + model$df.residual)
pr^2
```

## Overall Model

- So how much better than a random guess are we at predicting?
  - A good random guess is always the y-intercept or the mean of y. 
- The *F*-statistic represents the difference of the model from zero

```{r fvalues, echo = T}
summary(model)$fstatistic
```

## Overall Model

- $R^2$ represents the overlap in all IV variance with the DV variance

```{r r2value, echo = T}
summary(model)$r.squared
```

## Diagnostic Tests

- Outliers and influential observations: data points that have large residuals or are otherwise odd in relation to the rest of the data
- Assumptions of parametric regression:
  - Independence
  - DV is at least interval or better yet ratio scale
  - Additivity (no multicollinearity)
  - Linearity
  - Normality
  - Homoscedasticity/Homogeneity

## Outliers

- Hat values (or leverage): indicates how much influence on the slope a data point has
- Studentized residuals: the normalized (z-scored) difference between a participant's predicted and actual score 
- Cook's values: a measure of influence (both leverage and discrepancy)

## Outliers

```{r outlier, echo = T, message = F}
library(car)
influencePlot(model)
```

## Outliers

- What do we do with them?

```{r outliers, echo = T}
ELP[c(331,660,498,411), ]
```

## Assumptions

- Independence - the data is independent from each other (i.e. each data point is from a different "person")
- Interval scale dependent variable: check!

## Additivity

- No correlation between predictors above .9 (but .7 is actually not good either)

```{r additivity, echo=T}
summary(model, correlation = T)$correlation[ , -1]
```

## Additivity

- Small Variance Inflation Scores (VIF) values (less than 5 to 10)

```{r vif, echo = T}
vif(model)
```

## Linearity

```{r qqplot, echo = T}
plot(model, which = 2)
```

## Normality 

```{r normal, echo=T}
hist(scale(residuals(model)))
```

## Homoscedasticity/Homogeneity

```{r homogs, echo = T}
plot(model, which = 1)
```

## Homoscedasticity/Homogeneity

```{r homogs2, echo = T}
{plot(scale(residuals(model)), scale(model$fitted.values))
  abline(v = 0, h = 0)}
```

## One Solution to Bad Assumptions

- First, build a function that saves the numbers you want:

```{r boot, echo = T}
bootcoef <- function(formula, data, indices){
  d = data[indices, ] #randomize the data by row
  model = lm(formula, data = d) #run our model
  return(coef(model)) #give back coefficients
}
```

## Bootstrapping 

- Next, use the `boot` library to run the bootstraps (lots of runs on randomly sampled data)

```{r boot2, echo = T, message = F}
library(boot)
model.boot <- boot(formula = Mean_RT ~ Length + Log_SUB + POS,
                  data = ELP,
                  statistic = bootcoef,
                  R = 1000)
```

## Bootstrapping

```{r boot3, echo = T}
model.boot
```

## CIs for Bootstrapped Estimates

```{r bootci, echo = T}
boot.ci(model.boot, index = 3)
```
