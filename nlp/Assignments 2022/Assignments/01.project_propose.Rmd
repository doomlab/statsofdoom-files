Be sure to list the group members at the top!

## Topic

- Pick a movie that you would interested in analyzing. You can also use **two** one-hour long TV shows or **four** half-hour long TV shows. 
- Search for the subtitles for that movie or TV shows. Please note some of the subtitle websites are junk, do not download anything from a popup! Podnapsi appears to be an ok site. 
- Find the subtitles for your project.
- List your movie/show here (note that each group should have a different set of subtitles, I will coordinate). If you have picked a TV show, list the specific episodes. 

## Problem or Question

What is your interest in analyzing the subtitles for this movie/show? What questions you might you answer given this dataset? It's ok if you aren't sure right now, just put down some ideas.
