## Terminology

- Measured variables – the real scores from the experiment
  - Squares on a diagram
- Latent variables – the construct the measured variables are supposed to represent
  - Not measured directly
  - Circles on a diagram

## Terminology 

```{r echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
library(lavaan)
library(semPlot)
HS.model <- ' visual  =~ x1 + x2 + x3
              textual =~ x4 + x5 + x6
              speed   =~ x7 + x8 + x9 '

fit <- cfa(HS.model, data = HolzingerSwineford1939)
semPaths(fit,
         whatLabels = "std",
         edge.label.cex = 1)
```

## What is EFA?

- Factor analysis attempts to achieve parsimony (data reduction) by:
  - Explaining the *maximum amount of common variance* in a correlation matrix 
  - Using the *smallest* number of explanatory constructs (factors)
- Common variance is the overlapping variance between items 
- Unique variance is the variance only related to that item (error variance)

## Directionality 

- Factors are thought to *cause* the measured variables
- Therefore, we are saying that the measured variable *is predicted by* the factor

```{r echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
library(lavaan)
library(semPlot)
HS.model <- ' visual  =~ x1 + x2 + x3
              textual =~ x4 + x5 + x6
              speed   =~ x7 + x8 + x9 '

fit <- cfa(HS.model, data = HolzingerSwineford1939)
semPaths(fit,
         whatLabels = "std",
         edge.label.cex = 1)
```

## Why use EFA?

- Understand structure of set of variables
- Construct a scale to measure the latent variable
- Reduce data set to smaller size that still measures original information

## The Example Data

- We are going to build a scale that measures the anxiety that statistics provokes in students 
- Dataset is from the Field textbook

1.	Statistics makes me cry
2.	My friends will think I'm stupid for not being able to cope with R
3.	Standard deviations excite me
4.	I dream that Pearson is attacking me with correlation coefficients
5.	I don't understand statistics
6.	I have little experience of computers
7.	All computers hate me
8.	I have never been good at mathematics
9.	My friends are better at statistics than me
10.	Computers are useful only for playing games
11.	I did badly at mathematics at school
12.	People try to tell you that R makes statistics easier to understand but it doesn't
13.	I worry that I will cause irreparable damage because of my incompetence with computers
14.	Computers have minds of their own and deliberately go wrong whenever I use them
15.	Computers are out to get me
16.	I weep openly at the mention of central tendency
17.	I slip into a coma whenever I see an equation
18.	R always crashes when I try to use it
19.	Everybody looks at me when I use R
20.	I can't sleep for thoughts of eigenvectors
21.	I wake up under my duvet thinking that I am trapped under a normal distribution
22.	My friends are better at R than I am
23.	If I'm good at statistics my friends will think I'm a nerd

## The Example Data

```{r message = F}
library(rio)
library(psych)
master <- import("lecture_efa.csv")
head(master)
```

## Steps to Analysis

- Data screening (not shown, use last week's notes!)
  - Additionally, you need at least interval measurement for the analyses shown here
  - Enough items to group into factors (recommended 3-4 per potential factor)
- How many factors should you use?
- Simple structure
- Adequate solutions

## How many factors do I use?

- Theory
- Kaiser criterion
- Scree plots
- Parallel analysis

## Kaiser criterion

- Old rule: extract the number of eigenvalues over 1
- New rule: extract the number of eigenvalues over .7
- What the heck is an eigenvalue? 
  - A mathematical representation of the variance accounted for by that grouping of items

## Scree plots

```{r scree, echo=FALSE, out.height="500px", out.width="800px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("scree.png")
```

## Parallel analysis

- A statistical test to tell you how many eigenvalues are greater than chance
  - Calculates the eigenvalues for your data
  - Randomizes your data and recalculates the eigenvalues
  - Then compares them to determine if they are equal

## Finding factors/components

```{r}
number_items <- fa.parallel(master, #data frame
                            fm="ml", #math
                            fa="fa") #only efa
```

## Eigenvalues

```{r}
 
sum(number_items$fa.values > 1)
sum(number_items$fa.values > .7)
```

## Simple structure

- Simple structure covers two pieces:
  - The math used to achieve the solution: maximum likelihood
  - Rotation to increase communality between items and aid in interpretation
  
## Rotation

```{r rotation, echo=FALSE, out.height="500px", out.width="800px", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("rotate.png")
```

## Rotation
  
- Orthogonal assume uncorrelated factors: varimax, quartermax, equamax
- Oblique allows factors to be correlated: oblimin, promax
- Why would we even use orthogonal?

## Simple structure/solution

- Looking at the loadings: the relationship between the item and the factor/component
  - Want these to be related at least .3 
  - Remember that r = .3 is a medium effect size that is ~10% variance
  - Can eliminate items that load poorly 
  - Difference here in scale development versus exploratory clustering

## Run an EFA

```{r}
EFA_fit <- fa(master, #data
              nfactors = 2, #number of factors
              rotate = "oblimin", #rotation
              fm = "ml") #math
```

## Look at the results

```{r}
EFA_fit
```

## Item 23 

```{r}
EFA_fit2 <- fa(master[ , -23], #data
              nfactors = 2, #number of factors
              rotate = "oblimin", #rotation
              fm = "ml") #math

EFA_fit2
```

## Plots of the results

- The built in plot functions from `psych` are fantastic!

```{r}
 fa.plot(EFA_fit2, 
     labels = colnames(master[ , -23]))
```

## Plots of the results

```{r}
fa.diagram(EFA_fit2)
```

## Adequate solution

- Fit indices: a measure of how well the model matches the data 
  - Goodness of fit statistics: measure the overlap between the reproduced correlation matrix and the original, want high numbers close to 1
  - Badness of fit statistics (residual): measure the mismatch, want low numbers close to zero 
- Theory/interpretability 
- Reliability

## Fit statistics

```{r}
EFA_fit2$rms #Root mean square of the residuals
EFA_fit2$RMSEA #root mean squared error of approximation
EFA_fit2$TLI #tucker lewis index
1 - ((EFA_fit2$STATISTIC-EFA_fit2$dof)/
       (EFA_fit2$null.chisq-EFA_fit2$null.dof)) #CFI 
```

## Reliability

```{r}
factor1 = c(1:7, 9:10, 12:16, 18:22)
factor2 = c(8, 11, 17)
##we use the psych::alpha to make sure that R knows we want the alpha function from the psych package.
##ggplot2 has an alpha function and if we have them both open at the same time
##you will sometimes get a color error without this :: information. 
psych::alpha(master[, factor1], check.keys = T)
psych::alpha(master[, factor2], check.keys = T)
```

## Wrapping Up

- You've learned about exploratory factor analysis, which we will revisit when we cover confirmatory factor analysis 
- You learned how to examine for the number of possible latent variables
- You learned how to determine simple structure
- You learned how to determine if that simple structure was an adequate model
